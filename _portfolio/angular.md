## Explanation

I learned how to Bootstrap Angular into my Bloc Jams application.

## Problem

I needed to integrate the Angular javascript framework into my Bloc Jams application.

## Solution
I integrated Angular into my Bloc Jams application, configured routing and states for an application, implemented controllers for an application's view, created a service that controlled song playback, wrote a custom directive that controls song and volume sliders, and created a custom time code filter.


## Results

My Bloc Jams application became more dynamic with more functions in place. I still had trouble viewing the application.


## Conclusion

I believe the integration of Angular was successful and that the application worked properly but I still had trouble viewing it. I was surprised at how useful Angular was. In the future, I will use the information I have learned to put Angular into future applications.
