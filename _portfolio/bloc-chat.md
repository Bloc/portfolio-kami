## Summary

Bloc-Chat is an educational exercise created by Bloc.Io (an online coding school) in order to help students learn more about AngularJS.

## Explanation

As a Student I was given instruction as to the purpose of this app, and how to implement Firebase on the back-end to send and receive messages in real time. The main parties involved in this project were myself and Bloc.Io and my Mentor (bloc employee chosen by me for mentorship though-out the program) Wilson. Bloc was the institution seeking a solution to this assignment (problem) and I was the developer responsible for prividing a solution. Wilson was there for any questions I had along the way as well as any support and guidance I may have needed.

## Problem

I was given this assignment to follow through with a series of exercises in which a small problem was presented. The overall solution was to provide an application where students could use various chatrooms created by themselves to message back and forth in real time.

## Solution

My solution to this problem was unique because during my program I was fortunate enough to obtain my goal of becoming a Software Developer full-time. At my company we use Angular 4 as opposed to AngularJS which was the intended framework for this assignment. Wilson and I decided that this would be a great opportunity to kill two birds with one stone so-to-speak. I Would complete this assignment and pratice my craft for work as well.

## Results

 I chose to do this application using Angular 4 and it took me a little longer as the instructions for the app were intended for AngularJS but I eventually was able to produce an application that met or exceeded the requirements for a passing submission for this assignment, and I learned a ton along the way. I decided to test this application multiple times to ensure that multiple users could send and receive messages from any or multiple chatrooms.

## Conclusion

This application and my method of completing it was very successful. I think it was great for me to write this in Angular4 and I thank Wilson for obtaining permission for that as well due to my work situation. I was able to learn a lot from this process especially regarding the translation from AngularJS to Angular4. This was especially helpful for me at work. I will continue to use the many methods and utilities that I learned from this exercise both at work and in my continued learning opportunities.  This was an incredibly helpful and motivating experience and one of the first applications that I have completed in Angular4. Even as elementary and simple as it may be I will always remember how I did this and what I gained from the process.
