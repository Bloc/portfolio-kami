## Summary

Bloc-Jams is an educational exercise created by Bloc.Io (an online coding school) in order to help students learn more about Javascript and the Web Development process in general.

## Explanation

As a Student It was explained to me that we were going to use Javascript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Buzz audio library to make a website that streamed your online music collection. The home page features text shadowing and CSS transition animations for an animated user experience. Graphics from the Ionicons font library are also used for musical notes, radio wave, and the mobile device images. The Collection page, accessed from the link in the upper right corner of the home page, presents a set of albums. Each album references artist, album title, song count, and album art. Selecting an album loads the album page. The Album page includes album data from the Collection page, plus a track list with number, title, and duration. A player control with play/pause, skip back, skip forward, and sliders for controlling the position of the currently playing track as well as the volume.

## Problem

The overall presented theme for the "problem" was that our "Client" was seeking an alternative music player for their collection of media, that they could control online via a modern website with a built in media player.

## Solution

My solution to this problem was to create a beautiful responsive and dynamically scalable website that would look great on any platform from cell phones to tablets and even full-size desktop machines. I utilized the Buzz media library for the actual media playback functionality and took advantage of CSS' transition and animation tools for an added touch. I used jQuery to help keep the javascript coding to a minimum, and of course used HTML for the general scaffolding and structure of the site.

## Results

The website both looks and performs excellent.  I was able to test the multiple features by changing the media randomly, being that the media files were all local to my machine.  I was able to use google chrome tools to watch for any errors and I console logged out certain things to track for any issues along the way.

## Conclusion

Overall I am very pleased with the results of the website and was actually proud enough of my work to push it live online at one of my registered domains.  I would link to it now but I am going to put this profile on that site as soon as it's finished. The Client (Bloc.io) was very pleased as well as I received a passing grade for the assignment.
