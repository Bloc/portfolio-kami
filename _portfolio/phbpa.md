## Explanation

Leading marine transporation consultant and lobbyist, Paul H. Bea Jr. had been using a site built almost a decade ago using Microsoft Front Page. Mr. Bea is a highly regarded mind in his field, but his business website had not kept up with him. PHB Public Affairs did not need a feature-rich site, but it did need to be a reputable and informative place for new contacts to find out more about Mr. Bea's work.

## Problem

The client's website is not core to his business, which is why it hadn't been updated sooner, but nonetheless was in a state that did not reflect as well on his work as it should. The core problems with the old phbpa.com were that 1) it was visually and technologically out of date; 2) the content needed organization and updating; and 3) it was not easy to add new content.

Besides needing a new coat of paint, the site was not responsive. If someone met the client for the first time and pulled up his site on their phone, the site would be hard to read and navigate. The client's own profile and descriptions of his work had not been updated in a while, in part due to the lack of a content management system (CMS). The latter point had contributed to the general lack of significant updates in several years.

## Solution

The primary goal identified during discovery was to have a strong online presence to answer the question "who is he and what does he do?" for new contacts. It was not to be a transactional site or highly-featured contact portal. Unfortunately we did not have past analytics information to work with. However, after reviewing existing content, we decided on and information architecture that featured areas of expertise, services, and professional history. 

Mr. Bea was familiar with Wordpress from using it for his professional blog, [MTS Matters](http://mtsmatters.com), so we decided that would be the best platform for the project. For design, the client wanted something subtle and minimalist, but with visual nods to his work on marine transportation policy. The responsive design was to be built from the smallest screen sizes up ("mobile-first") using CyberChimps' [Responsive II](http://cyberchimps.com/responsive-ii/) as parent theme.
