## Summary

Bloc Jams is my first project on Bloc’s software developer track. Bloc Jams is a starting point to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. It also allowed me to learn how all three of these languages interact with each other.  It also gave experience learning how to use JQuery which is a JavaScript library. Challenging at times the amount of information gained from the project was well worth it.

## Explanation

Bloc Jams is a responsive music playing web site and the first project in Bloc’s software developer track. Bloc uses this project to introduce you to basic principles of HTML, CSS, Javascript. While the project progresses you are introduced to jQuery a JavaScript library. As a student I had to implement the code and problem solve errors that occurred along the way.

## Problem

To make a responsive music playing web site.  Bloc jams must be able to be used on normal computers and mobile devices.  The web site must have a collection of albums allowing the user to pick what they like to listen too.  Bloc Jams needs to allow a user to play, stop and skip songs. Also must allow playback control and volume control.

## Solution

After making the first version of Bloc Jams using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was apparent that the project had a lot of extra code. At this point in the project jQuery was introduced and the lesson of refactoring vanilla JavaScript into jQuery commenced.  Starting with removing static HTML and replacing it with JavaScript templates. This allowed me as a student to learn how to simplify time consuming tasks.

## Results

Bloc Jams allowed me to refine my ability to find errors using google inspect.  Using the console to log different JavaScript processes and determine the problem. Throughout the project I was required to research and find solutions online. Piecing together solutions for problems I had. Some of the resources I used where [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/), [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/) and of course help from my mentor.

## Conclusion

The Bloc Jams project taught me a lot about frontend web development. It furthered my knowledge on HTML and CSS. Bloc Jams introduced me to JavaScript and jQuery.  This project gave me a great starting point to continue the software developer track at Bloc.  Teaching me how, when and what tools to use to solve problems.
