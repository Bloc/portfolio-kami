## Explanation

Bloc Jams is an online music application that allows the user to play and pause a song, use the seekbar to get to a specific point in a song, has changing icons when a user hovers or clicks on them, and has the ability to play the previous or next song.

## Problem

An application was needed to be able to play and pause music, use a fully functional seekbar, be able to interact with the users mouse, and display and appealing website.

## Solution

I created play and pause functions as well as previous and next functions. I created an HTML website with CSS and displayed pictures. I created icons for the user that would change the song to play or pause when it was clicked. I created a seekbar so that the user could skip to a certain point in the song. I integrated music files into the application so that a song would play.

## Results


The application did what it was supposed to and I believe worked very well. I had trouble viewing the application and a difficult time testing if it could play and pause songs and use the seekbar. The background and images displayed correctly as well as the header.



## Conclusion

In the future, I will use the knowledge from this project to create music applications and better understand how to view my applications. I was surprised the layout came out well. I was surprised at how much goes into the properties of a song. I would have tried to find more ways to display my application if I could next time since I had such difficulty.
