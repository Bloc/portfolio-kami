## Summary
 I got the inspiration to build a bar-top arcade after I purchasing a raspberry pi. A raspberry pi is a small, cheap, and powerful computer about the size of a deck of cards. It has multiple uses but after some searching I decided to use mine as an arcade emulator. I also found many helpful tutorials online on building a bar-top arcades. Two of my favorites are <a href = "http://www.instructables.com/id/2-Player-Bartop-Arcade-Machine-Powered-by-Pi/?ALLSTEPS">here</a> and <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjN0kbcG9j0">here</a>.
