This was my first client website. They had a small web presence but wanted a more robust website, not necessarily a ton of features, but more than just a plain pdf copy of their menu hosted somewhere. I converted the client from a single page pdf website to a custom built CMS with Ruby/Rails which allows the client to add/update/delete menu items, reservations, and more. I created it with responsive web design for both desktop and mobile utilizing Sass, CSS Grid, and jQuery.
