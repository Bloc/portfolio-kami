## Overview
“Strikeitoff”  is a self-destructing to-do list application. The purpose of creating a self-destructing to-do list application is to prioritize to-do items based on the date it is created and add urgency  to get things done.  The application sends a remainder to a user before self destructing a todo item unless it is not completed by a user. The application allow users to create, edit and destroy  and mark to-do lists.
