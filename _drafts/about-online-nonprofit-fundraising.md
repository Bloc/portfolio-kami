*Note: For the sake of this post, I’m primarily discussing those that are created to influence public policy, the behavior of other groups (e.g., corporations), or educate the public and that depend on small dollar donations.*

This is a post I couldn’t really write while working at an org.

At most American nonprofit advocacy organizations (501(c)(3) orgs, if you’re nasty), staff are put in pretty terrible positions. On one hand, there’s the *mission*. The mission makes everyone feel good. Being true to the mission means closely following your guiding ideology, whether that is religious ideology, scientific rigor, or anything in between. If you have supporters, it’s probably because they like your mission. Your opponents hate it but, to everyone who matters, it is the candy.

On the other hand, you have your *resources*. As in any conflict, having sufficient resources is key to victory. Like any organization within a capitalist system, if you follow the chain of resources, eventually they translate to money. An advocacy nonprofit’s resource needs are almost all its cash. Physical resources, such as chairs, office supplies, or coffee can be donated, but once the office is set up, cash donations are almost always what you’re looking for.

I make this somewhat obvious point because all too often 

I understand that people want other ways to contribute — petitions, and emails mostly. Some people think that orgs only send fundraisers—and many do mostly do so due to fundraising goals they were given. But it’s typically not as much as you think. It’s easier to remember the annoying fundraising emails than the petition asks or the purely informational emails. And it’s a common practice to include a DONATE link at the bottom of non-fundraising emails. We don’t consider those fundraisers, but just making sure that someone who is momentarily inspired to give has an easy way to do it. I understand that any email with the word “donate” in it can seem to normal people like a fundraiser, though.

The non-monetary actions that make a huge different are harder and put people more directly in contact with those who they may be opposing — calls and office visits

Rallies are more fun, but also take more time and aren’t frequent. Becoming a local organizer is the greatest thing you can do, but it’s also a huge ask.

Donating feels more harsh, but it’s A) important. Donations fund the huge amount of behind the scenes work that makes advocacy happen.
B) Probably more palatable than something like volunteer organizing for most people.

Best solutions?
- Be demanding of the orgs you donate to. Donating money is a great gift, which is why you should find the orgs you believe in and find out what they’re doing with it. If you’re not satisfied, then choose another org.
- Unsubscribe with prejudice. Orgs would rather you not be on their list than you not open, hit spam, or delete. Those all hurt their deliverability.
- Become a monthly donor. Two orgs I love supporting are the DC Food Bank and the DC NPR station. I know if they sent an email every month I wouldn’t give, but once I set up a monthly donation for a small amount, I could know that I was doing a good amount to help and that I could happily ignore other requests.

WHAT ORGS DO WITH YOUR MONEY
- lots of things. most basically, rent, salaries and benefits, computers, reference books, pencils, etc

###What you can see
- people feel good about money spent on things they can see: organizing rallies, producing powerful videos, expeditions, building wells

###What you don’t see
- we tend to be less excited about the things we can’t see as a direct impacts: employee benefits, new chairs

For people like me, fundraising is about as fun to do as it is to receive. That’s reason number one that I’m transitioning from a role leading online grassroots fundraising to web development. Still, I think a poll of professional grassroots fundraisers would show you that it’s not their ideal position. I say this because there seems to be an impression that 

Original comment:
I only get asked to donate money - you got nothing else for me to do ? write emails to persons of interest - share this important story online - anything else biut the “please donate” question or even harder boldly showing me a button with the “donate” comaand ! Whales are important but in 7 years there will be also no more elephants… and a lot of other animals too - very harsh reality and I REALLY want to do something !!! But to command me or ask me to donate and then ?? Just sit back and watch some small number of people do what ?? I don’t want reports of what donated money did and does , I want to take part in saving the world but all people ask me is donate donate donate - I’m so sorry I don’t have PayPal, I do not have a credit card (I bank on debit status) so there’s no longer any reason to be subscribed to your newsletter… People really want more action in there lives than thrillingly donateing and then… emptiness and silence and than there thrill is gone - I’ve unsubscribed from a couple of “donate-newsletters” which were all very good causes which I fully support within my mind & heart - even by takeing actions (demonstrating in the capital of my country or writing the president of any country with a hearts-plea (need a little help there doh.) I sincerely hope them whale-killers will stop and choose another way to make a living - maby they will beco me naked heardressers ? or even activists themselves … I say have faith and strenght that the end of animal-genocide is at hand with in a decade or you will have to change your activist-job… which can only be a good thing if the animals stay alive !
