I am  a budding web developer, living in Alpharetta, GA. Currently,  I am a student of  Bloc.ioâ€™s Full Stack Development course, learning the  necessary skills to become a well rounded professional. I am passionate about  developing products that  help make sense of complex and unstructured data, and present it in an intuitive fashion.

When I am not coding, you can see me running behind my toddler - learning how to fine tune my tongue to an American ear, find patterns in activities and objects that I can also apply in programming and be persistent even when the world around you is in complete chaos. 

**Technical Skills:** Ruby on Rails, Rspec, JavaScript, AngularJS, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, SASS, Bootstrap, Grunt, Git, AWS, Heroku.
