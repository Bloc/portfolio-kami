I graduated in 2015 with a Bachelors in Statistics from the University of California Berkeley and I am looking to relocate to Los Angeles, California to pursue a career in coding.  

At the University of Berkeley I was introduced to coding and instantly felt a connection to coding. I studied R for two years working on various projects that involved null hypothesis testing, time series analysis, and complex sampling techniques all of which included R packages like ggplot. A little after graduating I discovered Swift and learned how to make iOS apps.   

A passion of mine is helping others which is why I decided to give back to my community by becoming a guest teacher at my previous school districts. It is here where I developed classroom management techniques to successfully manage over 100 studentsâ€™ daily and learned to adjust to any classroom and teach any subjects with short notice. While working for a school was always a goal of mine I decided to enroll myself in some computer science courses at my local community college continuing my longing for programming.  

I am now finishing up an Associates of Science in Computer Science and continue to learn new programming techniques and software development.
