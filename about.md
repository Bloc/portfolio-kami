I'm a versatile professional Integration Architect with 13+ years of expertise in analysis, architecture, implementation, and technical management of complex enterprise solutions.I've extensive experience and sound knowledge of Enterprise Application Integration (EAI), Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), Cloud Integration, and ERP (SAP, Oracle, Legacy) integration with strategic clients, suppliers, and key vendors. I've worked on industry-wide integration and implementation of API development tools: TIBCO, Mulesoft and webMethods in messaging, security, performance management, rules engine, API development and management and distributed team management.

My penchant for learning new technologies led me to experience the Ruby on Rails framework over the past year.Being in consulting for 8 years gave me the opprtunity to experience a variety of organizations' culture and build strong relationships with the client,customers,cross-functional teams,and various stakeholders. My vast array of technical skills combined with my strong interpersonal skills make me an asset to an organization.
