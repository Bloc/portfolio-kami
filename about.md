Hello, my name is Aaron and my goal is to become an expert Ruby on Rails developer. I love the language and I believe there is still so much untapped potential for it moving forward.

I am also learning AngularJS. While I think Rails can serve most purposes, it doesn't mean I will ignore emerging practices. Angular mixed with rails is a great combination.

- I was born an artist. Drawing things came easy.
- I grew up a carpenter. My Dad had his own construction company.
- I became a soldier in the U.S. Air Force being an F-16 mechanic.
- I studied to be a graphic designer and web designer at BGSU. Minored in Computer Science.
- After college I stuck with construction until I was hired to build a website by the real estate company who's buildings I was remodeling. The marketing guy gave me the title "Art Director." I helped rebrand the company and design all new marketing materials.
- I got married.
- I have two young boys.
- I'm learning Ruby on Rails

Computer Science was very fun and had I not already wasted all of my Air Force college money on a Visual Communication Degree I would have picked computer science as my major.

Thanks to Dave Ramsey, I learned about Ruby on Rails. I studied it and just wanted more and more.  So that is where I'm at today. I'm trying to become a better me. Trying to provide for my family. I'm trying to be a programmer.
