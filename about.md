Hello, my name is Brandon Kelly thank you for visiting my site. I am an aspiring Software Developer and had the itch to begin this journey for a few years now and in January 2017 I took a leap up faith to start this journey through [Bloc](https://www.bloc.io/).

I currently live in Scottsdale, AZ and am married to my beautiful wife of 3 years, Shannon. In October 2015 we were blessed with our first child, Logan. I enjoy spending my free time with family and friends. Of all the extracurricular going on in our life, my favorites have to be the Menâ€™s Slow Pitch Softball team I am on through my [church](http://gatewayscottsdale.tv/) as well as spontaneous dance parties with Logan.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out!
