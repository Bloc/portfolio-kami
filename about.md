Two things have driven my career since graduating little ol' Marist College years ago: a love of web technology and a desire to use my time on Earth for good. For most of the time since that has translated into working on, communicating through, and building nonprofit websites and digital communication tools. My professional alma maters have included the [1Sky campaign](http://1sky.org), [350.org](http://350.org), [EchoDitto](https://echo.co) (now Echo & Co.), and [Oceana](http://oceana.org).

My educational background has been in communication theory and practice in various forms. I earned a B.A. in communication from Marist and and M.A. in the same from Virginia Tech. During the latter program, I focused my research in online and advocacy communication, inspired by the boom in how activists and politicians were using websites, YouTube, blogs, and other technology to expand their reach. While MySpace has faded as a worthy subject of much research since then, new technologies have sprung up and multiplied like a digital hydra.

As a technical project manager and strategist, I led on builds including the [Wilderness Society responsive redesign](http://wilderness.org), [Pact website](http://pactworld.org/), [Oceana international and regional websites](http://oceana.org) (internal lead with external dev team), [World Food Program USA](http://wfpusa.org/), and several more as co-lead. I've also led digital strategy projects for clients including NRDC Action Fund, American Constitution Society, and Sabin Vaccine Institute, among others.

Now as a developer, I'm constantly impressed, excited, and a occasionally overwhelmed by all the languages, services, and techniques that we have available. [Check out my latest work](/work/phbpa/) and others listed [on the home page](/). The technologies I primarily work with include:

- Open-source CMS, including Wordpress and Drupal
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript
- jQuery
