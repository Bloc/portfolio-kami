I'm a recent graduate from the University of Alabama. Programming caught my attention a couple years ago, and I have recently been commiting all my time to learning the ways of software development. Currently, I'm enrolled in Bloc (a software devlopment bootcamp). It has taught me a lot about programming, and I'm hoping to learn much more in the coming months.
