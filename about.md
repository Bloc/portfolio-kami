Hi, I'm Jake. I'm a husband and father who also happens to be studying web development as a student at Bloc.io. I learned about web development and coding bootcamps in 2015. I tried it out and took various free courses and finally in 2016 I decided to take the plunge after I realized I couldn't put it down!

I created this blog to document my coding journey and to make myself reflect and put my thoughts into words. Here you'll see the projects I've worked on as I share my experiences. If you read this, I hope you enjoy it! Feel free to reach out to me if you have questions or are interested in web development too!
