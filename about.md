Hello. My name is Kimber and I'm a Full Stack Web Developer (to be) based in Boston. I'm a Marketer turned Developer with a love for building things and solving problems.

When I'm not coding, I can most likely be found taking photos of my pup [@lunatheoona](https://www.instagram.com/lunathetoona/).
