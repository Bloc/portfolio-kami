Two things have driven my career since graduating little ol' Marist College years ago: a love of web technology and a desire to use my time on Earth for good. I am currently a front end web developer at [Singlebrook Technology](http://singlebrook.com) in lovely Ithaca, New York. We are proudly a B Corp and love working with clients who share a passion for making a better world. I specialize in and love learning about responsive, accessible, and highly usable web development.

My educational background has been in communication theory and practice in various forms. I earned a B.A. in communication from Marist and and M.A. in the same from Virginia Tech. My professional alma maters have included the [1Sky campaign](http://1sky.org), [350.org](http://350.org), [Echo & Co. (n√©e EchoDitto)](https://echo.co), and [Oceana](http://oceana.org).

As a technical project manager and strategist, I led on builds including the [Wilderness Society responsive redesign](http://wilderness.org), [Pact website](http://pactworld.org/), [Oceana international and regional websites](http://oceana.org) (internal lead with external dev team), [World Food Program USA](http://wfpusa.org/), and several more as co-lead. I've also led digital strategy projects for clients including NRDC Action Fund, American Constitution Society, and Sabin Vaccine Institute, among others.

Now as a developer, I'm constantly impressed, excited, and a occasionally overwhelmed by all the languages, services, and techniques that we have available. [Check out my latest freelance work](/work/phbpa/) and others listed [on the home page](/). The technologies I primarily work with include:

- Open-source CMS, including Drupal and Wordpress
- HTML
- Sass/CSS
- Javascript
- jQuery
- Grunt

And please [get in touch](/contact) if you'd like to work together or connect about anything. Let's make some beautiful internet together.
