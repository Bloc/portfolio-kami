Currently, I work as an Academic Advisor in the Student Support Services department at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse. Everyday I get the opportunity to work with a great team, and have the opportunity to support, mentor, and help students as they navigate the college experience. Prior to becoming an Academic Advisor, I coached football at UW-L for two years.

In my free time I enjoy watching sports, drinking a nice IPA, trying out new restaurants around town, and watching any movie that includes: Fast Cars, Jason Statham, Superheroes, Mark Whalberg and Denzel Washington.
