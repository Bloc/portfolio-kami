In a world, where technology reigns supreme...

Hello.  My name is Drew Hollenback and I am a full-stack developer specializing in AngularJS and Rails.  I also have experience in raw Javascript, jQuery, HTML and CSS.  

My desire to change careers stemmed from my curiosity about coding, predicated in my entrepreneurial mindset, manifested in how I could bring my ideas to life in the digital age.  I see things from a unique perspective and love to ask questions.  I am a firm believer in “what you don’t know, you don’t know”, so it’s only natural to find out.

I have spent the past four years as a product manager at U-Haul International, working directly with Call Center executives to identify application needs and bringing them to life.  I believe my unique skill set as a product manager and developer give me a competitive advantage over other developers looking to break into the industry.  I have perfected the soft skills necessary to communicate with anyone and have leveraged that ability so that developers understand what the business wants and the business understands how development can help.

I am an eager learner, willing to take on new challenges with the attitude that I will only grow more if I am pushed to my limits.  My journey as a developer has only just begun but my excitement for what lies ahead grows daily.
