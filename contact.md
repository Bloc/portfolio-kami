If anyone out there would like to contact me, please fill out the form below and I will get back to you as soon as I can. Or if anyone is in Columbus, Ohio and looking for a buddy to code with then feel free to let me know! I look forward to answering any questions or even just chatting about Development with anyone interested. If you are interested in joining Bloc.io I would be happy to put you in touch with the admissions team.
