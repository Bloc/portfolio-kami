          <div class="about-text">
            <p>My name is Jordan Luse. I'm a proud San Francisco native with a never ending thirst for learning. I still currently live in San Francisco and surprisingly have not grown tired of what the city has to offer. As much as it's changed over the years there is still much culture to be had and shared with all in The City by the Bay.</p>
            <p> I'm a Software Engineer fasinated with Frontend technologies. I thrieve in collaborative enviroments and prioritize being the best team player on any project.</p>
            <p>My passions include DJing and producing music, sports (specfically Bay Area teams) and doing my best to maintain a healthy life style.</p>
