title: Career Change
---
I am attempting to change my career and my life. I have always been an artist and I have always dabbled in web design and development. This time, I'm trying to dig deeper. I am becoming a full-fledged programmer. So far, I love it. These are the three technologies I'm getting into right now.

* Ruby on Rails
* AngularJS
* TDD

My goal is to get a job working at a Ruby on Rails(RoR) centric web agency. I have thought about being a freelancer or owning my own company but I don't think I can do that at this point in my life. I really want to join a team that has the same passions I do about Rails. That is how I learn best, by watching and doing and collaborating.

I will be making more posts about my journey from a run of the mill glorified content manager to an expert in the Rails community. It will be hard, it will take sacrifice, and I will for sure have to move from Toledo, Ohio.

I am almost finished with my BLOC.io Ruby on Rails web development course. It's essentially a mini online bootcamp that teaches rails through reading, doing and mentorship through real world mimicked projects. It has been a fun 5 months, and now I'm ready to start honing my skills and becoming a productive team member. More to come!
