title: The Ups and Downs of Developing
---

When learning to become a developer you will have up and downs.  I like to refer the ups as the “ah ha” moments when a concept clicks. The downs are when you stare blankly upon your screen and have no idea what you have done.  The  up moments are can be far and few between at first. As you progress through your understanding of different developer languages they come more frequently.  When the up moment comes you need to ride it like a wave, embrace it.  You will find the inspiration to continue to push on in your learning.

The downs is where the rubber meets the road. Developing is not easy and ever changing languages and concepts does not help. During the down moments is where you will learn the most.  If you get stuck sometimes the best thing you can do is get up and walk away.  Give yourself time to think about the problem as a whole.  If you stay you might just end up focusing on one line of code and there might not be anything wrong with it. Find a strategy for when you get stuck is key when learning to develop.

Ninety percent of the time when you learning to code and something does not work it is a typo. It seems silly, but it is not. Typos can consist of just a misspelling or forgetting to close brackets. Closing brackets is a easy thing to fix, get in the habit of working between them.  This little strategy can save you a lot of frustration. Misspellings can be a lot harder to catch, especially when it comes to variables and named functions or anything you name yourself.  And do not get me started with typos in camelcase. I find one strategy that works for me is to work backwards through the code I have most recently wrote. Check all fixed spelled code first, then from there go through all named code. And don't forget to take a break from time to time and look at the big picture.

Remember learning to code is not easy, otherwise everyone would do it. Try to code every day, it is a repetitive process and the concepts don’t come without practice and implantation.  You will not wake up one morning and suddenly be the best developer.  Trust me on that. Keep coding and always enjoy the ups and learn through the downs.
