title:  My Goals as a Developer
---
My first *Goal* was to become a Developer. My time here at Bloc has given me the skills and confidence to operate in the Software Developer world as full-time Junior Developer. My goals have changed since becoming a Developer obviously that was the largest motivation of me attending Bloc.io I want to thank my mentor *__Wilson__* for all of the help along the way thus far, and the staff at bloc for creating such a quality program. So these are my goals now as a Developer.

* Finish Bloc and obtain my __Full Stack Developer Certificate__:

>*I plan on finishing bloc in January of 2018.  I am very excited to graduate the program and get my Certificate.  This has always been a huge goal of mine, to become a software/web developer, and now that I have I want to honor that success with this Certificate. I know it's just a __piece of paper__ but it will allow me to continue to grow and learn, become more valuable as a Developer, and help provide the safety and security that I am always seeking to improve for my family.*

* Continue learning and advancing my skillset:

>*This one is more of a rule to live by. I realize that this goal is one that does not have a finite end.  Rather this to me is more of a daily motto for motivation and perspective. I seek to remain teachable and constantly in search of knowledge. I feel this will make me a more humble person as well as allow me to take in things that sometimes others choose to overlook.*

* Start my own consulting firm:

>*This is more of a long-term goal. The main reason that I decided to get into this career field is because I always have loved solving problems. The intention to open a consulting firm is two-fold.
Firstly, I would be able to have potential clients come to me with their problems. We would discuss what there requirements and ideas were and I would help come up with a solution. The look on their faces when that problem is solved is what gets me out of bed in the morning. Secondly, this would allow me to feel a sense of accomplishment. I mean when a person spends twenty to thirty or 50 years in a given field, that person's experiences and knowledge is very valuable to that particular industry. I feel that if I open a consulting firm and if I was fortunate enough to have returning clientele, that to me would mean that others are seeking my experience and my knowledge in my industry. That would feel like an accomplishment to me.*
