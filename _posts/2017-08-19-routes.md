title: Routes, HTTP verbs, and URLs!

Something I've been working on mastering is the `routes.rb` file.

Below is a sample question I worked on with my answers:

>What urls does this code in your routes.rb file generate:
{:.center}
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/routes_question.png)

>Write out each url, its http verb, and the controller method that it will map back to.
