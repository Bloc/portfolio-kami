## Why Bloc?
About a year ago,I realized I needed to enhance my skills due to 
1. I'm always itching to learn something _**new**_  
2. I had this incessant need to get my hands dirty with code.
3. Sharpen my programming skills for better career prospects.

Until then,I had never heard about the concept of a _**Bootcamp**_ and it was pure coincidence when I chanced upon a bootcamp ad on my facebook page.The idea of learning new technologies,with mentorship and the community support, and the career help to go with it all sounded very interesting indeed.After a couple of months of researching bootcamps in the SF Bay Area(there are tons!),I honed the list to 3 - _**AppAcademy**_,_**Dev BootCamp**_ and _**Bloc**_. While the best thing about AA and DBC was the incredible career help(they invite companies to interview students),they were both very expensive.That and the lack of a part time option made me hesitant.Bloc on the other hand was cheaper,had an online and part time option,flexible hours,and good career services.After I attended one of Bloc's intro webinars, I was hooked and signed up within 2 days!

## Coursework
I'm a year into the _Part Time Web Program_ and the course content has been nothing but great.Back when I started in July'16 ,it combined teachings and lessons from Bloc's own with third party websites - CodeSchool,CodeAcademy etc. You learn the fundamentals first, then go hands-on with the checkpoints and assignments.As you dive deeper into the foundations,the assignments get harder and thats when you really grasp the material.There are programming checkpoints spread out across the Frontend and Backend courses which are great for reenforcing your basics.The content is well structured throughout so you're not overwhelmed at any point. Bloc also provides great references to blogs and other websites for a deeper perspective on concepts.I've actually ended up bookmarking many and refer to them when needed!

The coursework is also constantly updated with the newer versions of the tools and technologies.And the _**best**_ part - you've lifetime access to all of the awesome content!

## Mentorship and Community
The mentorship has been hands down,my favorite part of the program.Partly because I've been fortunate to have the awesomest and the coolest mentor([Brittany Martin](https://www.bloc.io/mentors/brittany-martin)) and partly due to the constant support and encouragement from the Bloc community.There are times when you will get stuck in an assignment and the mentor is ready to help you within a short notice.I've never experienced delays(even on weekends!) getting a response and thats a credit to Bloc and their incredible mentorship community.I've had my set of struggles but the mentor helps you navigate through the pain points.And you've the flexibility of changing mentors if you need to!.Bloc also has a _Slack_ channel to mingle with your fellow students and help with your technical roadblocks.

## Conclusion
The journey with Bloc has been fantastic so far.I had my doubts before joining Bloc but 10 months down the line,I'm incredibly satisfied! The coursework and the mentorship have been amazing.I've yet to fully experience the career services portion of Bloc,but it has been a good start so far.All in all,if you're willing to put in the hours and work hard,you'll love life with _**Bloc**_!
