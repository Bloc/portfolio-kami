title: My Bloc Experience
---

Bloc's *Software Development* program is definitely challenging. Prior to Bloc I had only been through a handful of tutorials on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/). They have laid out the basic fundamentals fairly clearly. Upon the start of my journey I expected that more would be handed to me and that coding would be easy. Guess what?!?! ***It's not!!***

What has honestly made the program is my mentor, Mike. He is beyond **helpful** & **patient** and has a heart of teaching others. I am so blessed to have picked him on a gut feeling...definitely a **God** thing. Mike cares for more than just the monetary compensation and genuinely cares for the people he is mentoring. I have had a lot of internal battles as to whether or not I should continue with the program due to being way out of my comfort zone and second guessing my passion. I can say that if he wasn't my mentor, I might have given up a while ago.
