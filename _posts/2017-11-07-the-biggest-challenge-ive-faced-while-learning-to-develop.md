title:  The Biggest Challenge I've Faced While Learning to Develop

---
I would say that the biggest challenge that I have come across while learning to develop would be learning to maintain my focus and patience while facing a stubborn problem.

I have always been a little *short-tempered* and learning to program/develop has been and continues to be a huge exercise in patients. Everyday I find it difficult to maintain a certain level of intention and focus. Please don't misunderstand me here, I am in no way, shape, or form referring to development as boring!

I simply mean to say that I personally have always struggled with maintaining focus because my mind is always moving and thinking about possible solutions and alternative approaches to any given task. If I find myself dealing with a bug or some task that is particularly cumbersome sometimes I get inpatient with myself or even the process in general. You'll hear this term in the industry as you go along as I have heard it many a time, "Trust in the Process," or "Stick with the Process." Both of which I practice daily. I struggle with delayed gratification and I am constantly telling myself that there is not always a short way out, or this will be worth the struggle in the end. It usually is.

I realize now that sometimes I need to ask for help and sometimes I don't know everything. It was hard to accept that one, but once I did and I started asking for help, I found myself progressing much faster than I would have if I had stayed quiet and stubborn!
