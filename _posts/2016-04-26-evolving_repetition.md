## Evolving Repetition
What in the world does that mean? It means doing the same thing over and over again, but from different perspectives. I think it is a very powerful way of learning.

For example, if I was going to teach you how to create a website with rails. I'm not just going to show you a way to set up a rails app by itself. I will say, lets think about what type of apps we can create. We could create a wiki, a fake twitter, a blog site, etc. If I stuck with one example and we completed the task, would you know how to vary the results right away? Would you see the nuances of the different set-ups? Would you have that repetition to know how to start a website? Probably not.

So in the following posts, I will attempt to bring this *evolving repetition* idea into my tutorials. We will learn multiple ways to set up websites and how the databases change depending on the type of data you need.

Thanks, be back soon.
