Bloc came along at the perfect time, when I was looking for a change but not quite sure what I wanted in a new career.  My curiosity in coding lead me to search for online options so I could learn the skills required while still working full time.  

Bloc is an online bootcamp for individuals looking to break into the developer world.  It offers a flexible part-time web development track that teaches the skills required to become a full-stack developer.  Although there are dozens of other bootcamp options, Bloc was the only one at the time that offered a true one-on-one mentor experience where you can meet with the same individual weekly to discuss pretty much anything.  During mentor sessions, we conducted code reviews, resume/cover letter review and preparation, concept check and understanding, and discussed family and current affairs.  It was an open forum and really helped me connect with my mentor on more than just a student-teacher level.

I actually had two mentors during my time in the program.  My first mentor Tim ended up accepting a higher position with Bloc and transitioned his students to new mentors so he could dedicate more time to making the program better.  My second mentor Chris was amazing.  He worked with me during my time in the backend phase, focusing on Rails.  His experience and knowledge were incredible and whenever I struggled with a concept or ran into a coding roadblock during a project, he was there to help.  We spoke about job searching and preparation at length towards the end of my program.  He had a great deal of advice since he had been in my shoes at one time and had been searching for new jobs himself.

My experience with Bloc was incredible.  I’ve learned things that would have been exponentially more difficult if I had chosen to learn them by myself.  The skills I have acquired will pay huge dividends down the road and will one day culminate into the dream job that I’ve always dreamed of landing.  I’ve made several connections with other students and have built my network considerably.  I love to share my story with other aspiring developers and hope my experience will be the springboard for those individuals to take the plunge into coding.
