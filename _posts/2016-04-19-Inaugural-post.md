title: Inaugural Post!

Back when I was nine or so I begged my parents for a diary. They gave in and got me one. I was so excited to have a place for my thoughts! I used it twice.

Let's hope I take better to blogging.

What you'll see in my blog are my general thoughts about life, my experiences as a developer and crazy ideas. I hope you'll enjoy most posts!
