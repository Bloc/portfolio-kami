Become a developer has not be easy and guess what, it still isn't easy now that I am one. Sometimes I look at the code of other developers and I think, how the heck did s/he come up with that? There's no way I would have gone in that direction!

So really the hardest thing about becoming a **better** developer is patience while I wait for new concepts to click in my brain. I should probably define what I mean. The click is actually understanding what a concept is, how I can apply it to different things and being able to apply it without too much effort.

Patience comes into play because I want to know all the ins, outs and what have yous (thank you Dude) of a concept now, today, as I code. I know consciously instant gratification in coding is not a reality for me but still I get frustrated.  Sure, there are some things I can just copy and paste from the Internet and with a little bit of adjustment and very little research, get to work. I’m not a fan of doing this because it doesn’t feel like it will ever get me closer to the click.

But maybe I should to be more open to the copy and paste? Maybe the more times I do this with a single concept, it will get me closer to seeing how if fits in, in different situations. I guess that’s possible but at the same time I’m afraid that my brain won’t actually learn it on a deeper level. 

When I take my mental time machine back to those long gone days of recording macros and using the results, I realize that, even then, there was resistance to it in Internet posts. It could be that that resistance has become ingrained in my consciousness and is holding me back from embracing the copy and paste as a learning tool.

As an experiment I'll specifically seek out a new concept and try it the copy and paste way. I'll do this instead of searching for a solution when I have a coding problem. One thing which I saw, while reviewing some Kata best practices (see paragraph 1!), which I sure will be a useful weapon in my coding arsenal, is let. Right now I know next to nothing about it so it is a blank page in my brain. I'll be posting again with the results of my experiment so please check back!
