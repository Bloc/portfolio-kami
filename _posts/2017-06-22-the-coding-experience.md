My introduction to coding  is a little different from others due to the fact that I have already been _developing_ applications for about 12 years. My background relates to completely different but relatable set of integration technologies([TIBCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIBCO_Software), [MuleSoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MuleSoft)).So before I started building web applications,I had been familiar with most of the tech jargon - _Object Oriented Concepts_,_HTML_, _HTTP_,_Webservice_,_API_ etc.

My primary motivation for taking up coding -

1. Learn new skills which could further open up avenues in the tech world.
2. Get really really good hands on.
3. Create new things and be independent

My tech background really made it comfortable to pickup the *Javascript* and *Ruby* fundamentals.Not easy,but comfortable enough. The web development frameworks(AngularJS,Ruby on Rails) were a little tougher to deal with but I eventually made my peace with them :). That being said,I wanted to share some learnings from my coding journey -

### Fundamentals
As the legendary [Michael Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan) once said -

> "When I was young, I had to learn the fundamentals of basketball. You can have all the physical ability in the world, but you still have to know the fundamentals."

Before you actually write any code,you'll have to learn the concepts of whatever you're seeking to learn - be it a language,a script or a concept.Make sure the concept has been completely drilled down inside your mind,body and soul.If you don't understand or half understand the concept,go through the lesson again.And again until you've nailed it.And if still cannot,seek help from an experienced resource on the subject or the world wide web.You cant neglect the fundamentals of _programming_ and go straight into building applications.Your much anticipated coding journey is going to come crashing down.

_Fundamentals_ are very very important.

### Mentorship
Mentorship is often an understated but an important aspect of learning to code.A mentor will not only guide you through the pain points when you're stuck,but also provide guidance on best practises,design patterns,potential hiccups, and be a constant encouragement throughout your journey.While I was fortunate enough to have been assigned a mentor from my web development bootcamp,I understand not everyone will be as lucky.But there are ways.

- Reach out to your network of friends and colleagues and seek help.
- Go to tech meetups in your area.
- Use social media to connect with developers.

Networking is also going to help you with your career down the line.

### Communities 
I believe a bootcamp is the best way to begin your journey into coding.You have a mentor,a structured coursework,accountability and career services to go with it.But if bootcamps are not your thing,there are a many online communities to learn programming and get good at them.Here are a few of them -

- [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
- [Codeschool](https://www.codeschool.com/) - _A personal favorite!_
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/courses/)
- [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)

Besides learning,there are other communities - [StackOverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) and [Google+](https://plus.google.com/communities) which will help you navigate through difficult situations in your journey.They provide 

- Tips and tricks 
- Problem solving 
- New and different perspectives
- Oppurtunity to network

### Perseverance 
My Crossfit trainer often asks our group "How badly do you want it?" just when fatigue and pain are about to hit us during our intense workouts.I started crossfitting about 10 months ago and it has changed my life.I often draw parallels from Crossfit to everything I do in life and that includes coding. After every [WOD](http://www.mensfitness.com/training/build-muscle/what-wod-decoding-language-crossfit), I am left with the feeling of "extreme satisfaction" - a condition where the state of body and mind are at peace with each other because they both know they've given everything - every ounce of energy to the WOD.I might have made that up but you get the gist!

Coding is similar to Crossfit in many ways than one.You need to ask yourself some of the same questions before you learn to code -

1. How badly do you want to learn to code?
2. Coding is a long and ardous journey.Do you have what it takes to last the marathon?
3. You WILL be stuck at times and want to give up.Do you what it takes to keep at it and come back stronger?
4. Learning to code is a step by step process and you cannot be an awesome developer overnight.Do you have the necessary patience?

Coding is extremely fun,intuitive and an extremely rewarding exprience if you do it right.The idea of building your first app from scratch and see it come to fruition is an amazing feeling.

Since I'm a sucker for quotes ,I'm going to leave this gem here - 

> “Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard ya hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done!”
