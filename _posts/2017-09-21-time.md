title: Using update_attribute to Set Attributes in Active Record
---

I've been busy working on my latest application, a to-do list app called All Done. One of the features is to have a 7 day countdown for every task and have it displayed. To do this I added the following line to my code:

{:.center}
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/alldone_display_time_code.png)

This uses the distance_of_time_in_words helper method to display the number of days since a to-do item was created. The first argument passed through the method is the starting point from which time is calculated. I set this to when the task was created plus seven hours (`item.created_at + 7.days`). The second argument is the end time which is set to the current time (`Time.now`). More info about the helper method can be found [here](https://apidock.com/rails/ActionView/Helpers/DateHelper/distance_of_time_in_words).
