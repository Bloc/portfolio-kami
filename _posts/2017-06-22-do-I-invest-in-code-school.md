title: Do I invest in a code school?
excerpt: How I made my decision about going to code school. The questions to ask yourself.
---
If money and time were no object, everyone interested in being a developer would say yes. For most of us though that isn’t the case. My first inclination getting started was no, there are a lot of free resources and I can learn this on my own. I started down that path and did learn some but ultimately felt like I was no longer progressing. I was acutely aware of how much I had to learn and how the resources were getting progressively more limited to move to the next level. I was also concerned that I may not be learning best practices and the perfectionist in me didn’t like that. 

So I started researching code schools and degree programs, and immediately got sticker shock. To make matters worse most were full-time and you couldn’t work. The questions I finally had to ask myself were…

* **Learning on your own do you think you will be able to become a hirable developer in a year?** My answer was no. I may gain some skills but didn’t feel like I would have enough to actually get hired, especially within a year.
* **Should you invest in a lower cost program?** While tempting, I had tried one lower cost program, which was helpful but made me nowhere near hirable. There were some that probably would have been better for a little more money, but judging by reviews wouldn’t get me to my ultimate destination.
* **Do I quit my job and just go all in for a few months at an in-person bootcamp?** LOL, no I have responsibilities and bills to pay. It was fun to think about for a half-second though.
* **If I don’t become a full-time developer and just dabble will I be okay with that?** Well by this time I was already hooked and knew this is what I wanted to do for a living. It was the first time in my life I was so certain about a career path, so not doing it wasn’t an option.
* **Do I invest in a serious online program and will it be worth it?** I researched my research, I was so diligent. I wanted to make sure that if I paid the big upfront cost that I was going to get my money’s worth. What are the reviews like on the school, what is the curriculum cover, how do they support me as I learn, what are the payment options and the big one… can I get a job as a developer after completing it? What does the ROI look like on this, especially since I am in a smaller town? 

Ultimately, I decided Bloc was my best option and looking at the short and long term earning potential it made financial sense. Plus, the fact I could get in my chosen career path relatively quickly and gain that extra “happy” bonus of doing something I love put it over the edge. Each person will need to make their own decision but hopefully sharing my story helps.
