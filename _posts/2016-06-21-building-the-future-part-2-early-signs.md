title: Building the Future, Part 2- Early Signs
---

Figuring out what I wanted to do with my life has been a major preoccupation of mine for years. By the time I was a teenager, I was taking long walks around my parents’ neighborhood to clear my head. I was never a talkative person, but I’ve always been a thoughtful one, and these walks helped me think through events in my life and rationalize various aspects of how the world functions to myself.

Even before that, logic and reason were imperative to me. My parents did a pretty good job of hiding the big Santa Claus secret from me, but I guessed for myself that it was physically impossible for one fat guy to travel around the world, dropping off presents at every house, even if one were to assume that he had flying reindeer. In kindergarten, when my teacher told us what drugs were, I made the connection that my dad often referred to himself as a “drug rep” (he was a pharmaceutical salesman for Pfizer, not a drug dealer). I came home upset, mistaking him for a meth dealer. I did not have all the facts, but I was making those connections. And from elementary school onward, I was regularly in advanced classes in Math and English, and went so far as to win the Spelling Bee in sixth grade for my school. I was good at memorizing facts and information even then, which, if I had had a clearer mind for these things, I should have embraced as a strength of mine. Being a child with bipolar disorder, of course, I was instead more bothered by my subpar performance on the football field, my poor artistic abilities, and, worst of all, my social awkwardness that made it difficult to make friends.  
  
Looking back, these signs seem like obvious evidence that I would be a great fit for a career in software engineering. But I didn’t pick up on this until years later.  
  
Instead, the first strength a teacher ever talked about in front of the class was my writing ability. I read books constantly as a kid, having few friends to spend time with and a constant need for more information that could not be sated, especially before Google became a household name. This, I think, led to my knack for writing and spelling. My fifth grade teacher took me aside after a creative writing assignment and told me that he thought I would make a good writer. I would still like to make writing part of my life in some facet because of that day, when I first had an encouraging, supportive teacher tell me that I excel where others don’t. But even though I was in love with fantasy novels as a kid (I read *Harry Potter* and *The Lord of the Rings* until the bindings broke), it has never quite fulfilled me to write fictitious stories. The best of them can deliver a powerful message, sure, and stories are an essential part of our culture. But I’ve always wanted to do something with my life that has a tangible, positive impact on the world. That makes people’s lives better.
