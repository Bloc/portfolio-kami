One of the most rewarding parts of my current job is helping people with the things I create. I am good at what I do but there's always been missing something, which is why I went on the Bloc journey. What I've been missing is being in a position to create true long-term impact and of course, before Bloc, having the knowledge to do that with a modern programming language, like JavaScript. This is what I want to do with my Full stack education (and continuing education): improve people's daily lives with what I create.

Hey there developer noob, maybe you need to slow down and be realistic. Rome's code base wasn't built in a day you know.

Don't misunderstand me. I am a realist when I pursue projects. But at the same time I always want to have the big goal in mind because it inspires me to keep pushing. What I've come to realize lately is that if I don't try something because it might not work out, and if the people around me do the same thing, it will definitely won't happen because, honestly, life moves on.

Ok, let's break this down. Have a lofty goal? Check. Have modern developer skills? Check. Can deploy applications? Check. Have the application that will improve people's daily lives? Can't mark that one off... yet. I'll get there at some point and I hope I'll be in a place where that's the norm rather than the exception.  If you have a big goal in your head or even out there on the Internets, reach out and we can chat about chasing windmills and why, sometimes, that's a good thing.
