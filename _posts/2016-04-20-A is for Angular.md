title: A is for Angular
---

I don't have an exact memory of the experience, but I'm sure I learned the ABC's the same way as other kids. I imagine, then, that my experience with learning Angular isn't too different from other people's. Even so, I hope you find my thoughts about Angular useful, especially if you're trying to decide if you want to learn it.

Brass tacks: I like Angular. But how did I get to the point of liking it? As part of my Bloc apprenticeship I was given the freedom to do a capstone project using languages and frameworks we had learned during the Front End course. A good chunk of the course was spent building an application using HTML, responsive CSS, JavaScript and JQuery. The next part of the course was Projects. One of the projects I could have chosen was refactoring the same application using Angular. I ended up not doing that. Instead I chose to use Angular in my own capstone. That, to me, is the funny part. I had never touched Angular in my life and I was going to jump right in and try to use it. Looking back, that seems like a crazy plan.

Learning the basics of Angular did take some doing but I was able to successfully use it in the capstone. So, this is why I like Angular. With not too much effort I put it to use. I guess it's possible I'm a genius and that's why it worked out. I don't think so. I think basic Angular has quick adoption baked in. This is probably why Bloc itself didn't have to spend as much time presenting it as, for example, JavaScript.  What else do I like about it? I like the way data binding is used in the HTML, or at least I like the way I used it. A simple directive, a couple of open and close curly braces connected to a clearly set up object in the JavaScript file and wham-o, binding complete!

How does Angular compare to other frameworks I've learned? After I finished the Back End in Bloc I considered Rails the cat's meow. I didn't realize I would like another framework  just as much as it. Which leads to another interesting topic, the Rails vs. Angular learning curve. Bloc spent a lot more time on Rails than Angular. Does that mean it's harder to pick up than Angular? I can't say for sure because it could be that I can do more with Rails than Angular if I had to. As it turned out Rails was harder for me to pick up. Again that could be because it went more in depth.

Ultimately, I hope that you give Angular a try based on what you've read here. It is worth it.
