title: My Goals as a Frontend Developer
---
I have always thought of myself as visual person, from the way I learn to the way I conceive ideas. This way of thinking is what I think translates to my fasination to the visual aspect in web development. The goals I have set for my self as a frontend developer are going to be ever changing, with more experience I gain there will always been new areas to explore. As for my goals at this point I definitely have a few.

* Be able to speak more fluenty in code.
* Have my ideas reflect projects.
* Become a professional developer.

__Speak Code__:
The ability to converse in code is something I would love to completely master one day, but at least for now having a clear understanding what is going is important to me.

__Know what Im doing__:
I want to be able to know where I put things, why I put things and when to put things on a web page. Being able invision something and then execute the way I want is something to master.

__Get the Job__:
After all this is more than hobby for me. I do get joy out of coding and it's instant gradifaction but  I want to take it to the next step and become a full time developer

> So far these are some solid goals as a beginner developer that I would love to achieve.
