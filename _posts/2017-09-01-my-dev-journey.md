title: My journey into development
---
I developed a strong work ethic from an early age because my parents never gave me anything; I always had to earn it.  When I was 12, I wanted a computer game called StarCraft that was around $55.  Due to strict child labor laws in the US, getting a conventional job was out of the question.  I struck up a deal with my dad to do some good ol’ fashioned manual labor in the backyard.  He had purchased 1000 Mexican styled pavers that he wanted to install around our pool deck.  During a hot Arizona summer morning, I transported 15 pavers at a time in a wheelbarrow from the front driveway to the backyard and stacked them several feet apart.  It was hard work but it made me appreciate that game so much more every time I played it.

I bought my first car when I was 16 with money I made from bagging groceries at Fry’s Marketplace and serving ice-cream at Dairy Queen.  When college rolled around, while most students were buried in debt, I was working part time to pay for my living expenses and tuition, all while graduating from the Eller College of Management with a Bachelor's Degree in Marketing.

After college, I worked for 18 months as a pricing analyst at U-Haul, setting rates for trucks and trailers based upon historical data and trends.  Knowing that wasn’t my calling, I transferred to another group as an Operations Manager, overseeing the largest pickup/delivery/storage service for college students in North America.  Wanting more of a role working with technology, I accepted a new position as a product manager, working with call center executives to define application enhancement requirements and coordinating with development teams to roll out the changes.

In May of 2016, I decided to take the plunge and embark on a new journey that I knew would push me to new levels of discomfort, all with the intent to acquire the necessary skills to change careers.  I enrolled in an online bootcamp called Bloc.  My wife and I were expecting our first kid in January, I still had to work a full-time job, and life always decides to throw curveballs at you during the least opportune times.  I put my head down and dug in.  Through ups and downs, wins and defeats, laughter and maybe a small tear, I’ve transformed into a respectable coder with confidence that I can contribute in a professional setting.  My journey has only just begun and I can’t wait to see where my career will take me in the near and long term future!
