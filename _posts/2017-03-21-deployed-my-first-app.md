Exciting news! After about two months, I've deployed my first web application! It's called Bloc Jams, which is a real functioning digital music player. If you check it out, you can also enjoy the soundtrack from one of the hottest Korean dramas of this year (what a bonus!).

This is how I cut my teeth on applying what I learned in the JavaScript foundations, by using it in a real app. On top of that, it taught me how to use jQuery to refactor the code for the app after I built it in plain JavaScript. You can learn more about it through the case study that I wrote for it.
