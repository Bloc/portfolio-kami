  So far, I’ve mostly tried to keep these blog posts readable for everyone, whether they know how to program or not. I wanted to establish some of my thoughts about learning to program and my views on technology to kick things off and get everyone on the same page who happens across my site.
  
  Today, however, I wanted to give more of a status report on my coursework at Bloc, which may require us to get a little more “into the weeds,” as they say, so bear with me.
  
  Bloc’s Software Engineering Course begins with some “Foundations” lessons, which start from what is quite literally square one. Even though Bloc has its users do some prep work beforehand, it assumes that the student either knows nothing or very little about programming going in. This was perfect for me, because aside from dabbling a little bit in Codecademy courses and a handful of Swift courses before this, I had no experience as a software developer before Bloc.
  
  So I was learning the building blocks of programming. Bloc’s course begins by teaching the Ruby programming language because it’s a more modern language than many other options (which is to say it reads a little more like English than, say, JavaScript), and because Ruby and its web development framework, Ruby on Rails, can take developers from zero to a fully-built website faster than most other languages can. Combined with this were lessons in the fundamentals of HTML (often called the “skeleton” language for websites), CSS (a sort of supplement to HTML used to stylize web pages), and using Github in conjunction with Rails.
  
  Github, for those who don’t know, is a tool developers use to track the changes they make to a website or app, so if they make a minor change and brick the whole thing, the whole project doesn’t come crashing down. It also allows for teams of developers to collaborate without stepping on each other’s toes by producing different “branches” of a project. So, for example, a master branch is usually the one being used to power the website you’re viewing online, while developers work in their own individual branches on various pieces of the site and only connect it back to the master branch when they know for sure it won’t break anything.
  
  Make sense? Hope I didn’t lose anyone there.
  
  With those pieces of the programming world in place, and with just a pinch of JavaScript thrown in for good measure, the Foundations section had me build a mockup version of Reddit- which is effectively useless in that the site is a social network with no users, but was certainly helpful in teaching me to go from nothing to a fully-functioning web application in just a couple months of work. If you’d like to check it out (you can even make an account and say hi if you want to), stop by https://ancient-ridge-92768.herokuapp.com.
  
  Now I’m moving on to the Ruby on Rails Projects section of my course at Bloc, the first of which will be a wiki-building app that I’ll be putting in my portfolio on this site soon. It’s going well so far- not least because I finally fixed the email issue I was having a few posts ago. Stay tuned!
  
  Or go back to reading *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child*. Your choice.
