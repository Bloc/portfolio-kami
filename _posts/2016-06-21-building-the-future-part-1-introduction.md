Given all of the contradictory elements that constitute childhood, it’s no wonder that so many of us have a hard time figuring out who we are and what we want to become. Our parents try to raise us to be good people, but err in favor of making a copy of themselves minus the flaws. The best schoolteachers encourage us to follow our passions and our talents, hunting through thousands of math tests, English essays, and science projects to point out where we naturally excel, but can easily overlook the importance of building well-rounded individuals. Our sports coaches push us to succeed, to win, but often forget that there is just as much, if not more value in learning from a loss than celebratnd our peers, of course, can be anything from the most supportive friends to the most damaging influences of all. I am no exception to this rule. It took me years of self-doubt, conflicting emotions and struggle to figure out what I wanted to do with my life, and I still only have a general idea of where I want to go. This is partly because I overanalyze every facet of the world I run into, but I think it also has to do with how often I was (unintentionally) steered off course as a kid.  
  
Now make no mistake: I have lived a very fortunate life. I grew up in a middle class family in Fort Collins, Colorado, the eldest of three children in a family that was, until just recently, whole. I have never truly feared for my own safety or wanted for food.  
  
My point in saying this is that when I do talk about the struggles I have overcome—growing up with bipolar disorder, being the quiet, unpopular kid in school, my massive pile of college loans, watching helplessly while my family fell apart, and confronting my constant desire to matter, to make a difference—it is not with the intent of asking for pity. Instead, I want to share the experiences that have led me to pursue software development, so that others struggling to find themselves might learn from my story and my decisions.  
  
If you want to be a software engineer too, or are looking to meet other like-minded individuals, I hope this blog gives you some insight into my journey as a developer. But I also hope that anyone with a dream, whether it’s becoming a musician or going to Mars, can learn something about pursuing those dreams by reading my story.  
  
In Part 2, I’ll tell you a bit about the first signs that I would be a good fit for the world of software development.adsfadfadfasdf
