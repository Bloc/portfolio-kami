title: Learn With Me

If you're just getting into web development, or software engineering, and you have no clue where to begin, stick with me and I will show you the road I'm taking to get where we plan on going.

> This will not be easy.

I feel like I can explain things in easy to understand terms. I am still fresh enough to know that people do not understand many of the tutorials out there because most experts don't remember how to connect to the true novice. Sometimes it feels like there is a missing disclaimer at the beginning of a tutorial that says *"I am going to assume you pretty much know everything that I knew before I learned what I'm going to teach you today.""* Sometimes, for people that aren't programmers, we need more than a good foundation, we need a shovel. We have to dig to find the solid ground on where we will put the foundation. So, if you're in need of a shovel, I'm going to help you dig down and find that solid ground.

The shovel we use to dig that hole changes in size based on how easily our brains can grasp the concepts. It's true, some people are brilliant and have big giant shovels. For some people that shovel is more like a garden trowel. It's not that you aren't capable of digging the hole, it just takes longer to grasp the concepts. The shovel isn't a constant size either, it has a snowball effect once we start to understand things.

I will attempt to come up with some of my own tutorials and I will also attempt to go through other people's tutorials from the perspective of a complete novice. I will not teach HTML or CSS. [CodeCademy](https//www.codecademy.com) does a great job at that. They also do a great job at many other technologies.

One thing you will notice if you are like me, you just find yourself copy and pasting A LOT. Then, at the end of the tutorial, if you were to do it all over again by yourself, you didn't really learn anything. I'll have more posts with some great tips on how to maximize your learning through tutorials with what I call "evolving repetition," it's not as oxymoronic as it looks. More to come...
