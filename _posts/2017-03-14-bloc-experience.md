title: My Experience with Bloc
3/14/17

So far my experience with Bloc has been a positive one. I am based in the Bay Area, specifically in San Francisco where their head quarters are located. This has given me a chance to actually meet people involved in person. This has inspired me to push myself knowing that are people that really care about sharing their knowledge to better the community we are involved in. 

As for the material, I have been enjoying the approach, because I've tried to learn how to program on my own and the structure just hasn't been there. Taking a project approach to learn new technologies and languages has given me more understanding into how things are used instead of just what they do without being applied.

The workload I admit has been tough due to the fact that I work a full time job while attending Bloc, but its no excuse, it just shows myself that this is something I really want to start and finish successfully, really working hard towards that end goal of starting  new career in an industry I actually care about.
