"We are part of this universe; we are in this universe, but perhaps more important than both of those facts, is that the universe is in us."

-Neil Degrasse Tyson-


What would you do if you captured the universe in a jar? What a catch. A giant landscape with endless possibilities, in your jar. Everyone has captured a universe. Everyone is living in their captured universe. Mine is software.

I began this journey only a couple months ago. I wrote my first code in December of 2015. "Hello World" popped onto my screen. I muttered "Hello" back to my computer and realized I had been given a key to a universe so expansive, and so endless that ideas began to blossom out of nowhere. I had turned back time to when I was a child and the world was my oyster.

But what do you do with an endless world? You explore, and thats what I am currently doing. I am finishing up my first leg of my year long journey with my school Bloc. I have been given a mentor (Mark Carpenter) who is guiding me in his Yoda like wisdom of code. I will be writing about that journey here. The ups the downs the people and the places. It won't all be code it will have some Stoicism, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Batman, My white golden retriever Boo, my fiance Alli, Oreos, and other random thoughts/going ons.

Thanks for listening, I need to go eat some more Oreos now.
