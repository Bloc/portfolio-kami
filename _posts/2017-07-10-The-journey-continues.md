title: The Journey Continues

It was once said that the more you learn the more you realize you don't know. 

I think this is especially true in the programming world.  I went back to school 17 years ago to pursue a career in programming.  I got a job as a programmer/analyst and that has worked out well however you can get stuck in a certain language and the world of programming and develop continues to move forward.  At this point I am trying to get current on some of the many changes in the development world.

> Where do you start?

When you start to look into the best place to continue your education you realize that there are so many directions that you can pursue and it can get pretty discouraging pretty fast.  Where do you spend your time?  What area will give you the best benefit?

One thing I will say is that it is a never-ending process.  Sometimes we get complacent and we need to be reminded to get out there and see what going on in the world.
