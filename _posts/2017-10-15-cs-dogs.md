title: What dogs teach us about customer service


---
The other night my dog Buster got stuck under the bed. He’s a largish hound mix with a barrel chest. He should not fit within the five inches of clearance between our floor and the bed. I don’t know how it happened; he didn’t know how it happened either.

I got out of bed while it was still dark, felt a cold nose on the back of my foot, turned the light on, and saw a sad dog head sticking out from under the frame. I got my wife up, we freed him, and he ran around the house for a while before settling back down on his totally comfy, non-scary dog bed.

I had so many questions...
