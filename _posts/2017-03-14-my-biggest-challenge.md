title: My biggest challenge faced when learning to develop.
--

So far on my learning to develop journey the biggest challenge I've encountered is basically, "Where do I start". I've noticed on coding challenges(like algorithms, etc.) I find that the hardest part is getting my initial thought process down on the page. Once things get going, the creativity starts flowing and I can actually explore different techniques for solutions. It's sometimes very frustrating becuase I feel like I always have to search for a way to begin a solution then just comming up with completely on my. 

This challenge also translates into projects as well. There have been certain checkpoints in Blocs curriculum that allow the students to figure out a section on their own and I find it difficult to put the beginning pieces together.
